# Wi-Fi-clone-detector
Developed a lightweight Python-based tool to detect Evil Twin Wi-Fi attacks by analyzing SSID, BSSID, signal strength, channel behavior, and encryption methods. The system alerts users when suspicious access points are detected, reducing the risk of data interception.
# Description
Designed and implemented a lightweight cybersecurity tool to detect Evil Twin attacks in public Wi-Fi networks. The system continuously scans nearby wireless environments and analyzes SSID, BSSID, signal strength, channel behavior, and encryption inconsistencies to identify cloned access points and alert users before connection. Built using Python with Scapy / PyWiFi, the solution is platform-independent and optimized for real-time detection.
